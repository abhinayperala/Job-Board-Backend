# Job Board Platform

## 🚀 Overview
This is a backend API for a **Job Board Platform**, allowing users to **register, log in, post jobs, apply for jobs**, and retrieve job listings. The project is built using **Node.js (Express.js) and MongoDB** and deployed on **Render**.

---

## ✅ What’s Working?
- **User Authentication (JWT-based)**: Users can register and log in.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Only companies can post jobs, and job seekers can apply.
- **Job Posting & Retrieval**: Companies can create jobs, and users can fetch job listings.
- **Apply for Jobs**: Users can apply for available jobs.
- **MongoDB Database**: Stores users, jobs, and applications.
- **Deployment on Render**: Available at [Job Board API](https://job-board-backend-eodc.onrender.com)
- **NOTE** : Render web-service automatically goes to sleep due to inactivity because it is on a free tier
---

## ❌ What’s Missing?
- **WebSocket for Real-Time Job Updates**: Currently, job listings don’t update in real time.
- **Rate Limiting & Security Features**: Needs middleware to prevent abuse.
- **GraphQL Support**: Currently, only REST API is implemented.
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Some API responses need better validation and error messages.
- **Unit & Integration Tests**: No automated tests are implemented yet.

---

## ⏳ How Would You Improve It With More Time?
- **Implement WebSockets** for real-time updates on job postings.
- **Enhance Security** by adding rate limiting, input validation, and improved authentication.
- **Expand the API** with GraphQL support for more flexible queries.
- **Improve Error Handling** with detailed validation messages and logging.
- **Add Testing** using Jest or Mocha/Chai for API reliability.
- **Improve Deployment & Scalability** by adding Docker support and auto-scaling configurations.

## 💻 Installation & Usage
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/job-board-backend.git
   cd job-board-backend
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Set Up Environment Variables (`.env`)**
   ```env

5. **Test the API with Postman**
   - **Register** → `POST https://job-board-backend-eodc.onrender.com/api/auth/register`
   - **Login** → `POST https://job-board-backend-eodc.onrender.com/api/auth/login`
   - **Create Job** → `POST https://job-board-backend-eodc.onrender.com/api/jobs` (Requires authentication which means that you need to be registered as company instead of job_seeker)
   - **Get Jobs** → `GET https://job-board-backend-eodc.onrender.com/api/jobs`
   - **Apply for a Job** → `POST https://job-board-backend-eodc.onrender.com/api/jobs/:id/apply` (Requires authentication, need to be a job_seeker)
